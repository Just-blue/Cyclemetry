## Forked from Original Repository

This project is a fork of [cyclemetry](https://github.com/walkersutton/cyclemetry) by [walkersutton](https://github.com/walkersutton). The original project was designed to generate GPX video overlaysã€‚

## Modifications in This Fork

The following changes have been made in this fork:
- Added Shimano di2 Gear display for monitoring gear shifts during rides.
- Adapted grad feature for climbing, including dynamic adjustments based on the gradient.
- Added distance display for tracking total distance covered.
- Modified the input file format to support FIT files.

(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to

I need to make Cyclemetry a bit easier to use. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/gqn5MfcypH4) where I explain how I'm currently using the tool. I plan on writing a more concise user guide in the coming weeks.

## Alternate Tools
* [DashWare](http://www.dashware.net/) (only available on Windows)
* [Garmin VIRB Edit](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/573412)
* [GoPro Telemetry Extractor](https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/) ($150/$300? - fuck that)
